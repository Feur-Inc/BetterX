export default definePlugin({
    name: "YourPluginName",
    description: "Description of your plugin",
    authors: [Devs.YourName],
    // Set to false if your plugin can be enabled/disabled without a restart
    requiresRestart: false,
    start() {
        // Initialization code
    },
    stop() {
        // Cleanup code

            description: "Description of the option"
            onChange: function() {
